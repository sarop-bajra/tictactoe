• a general description of the project
  Project 0's objective was to create a TicTacToe game using html, javascript, jquery and css.
  During the project I got to revise on the topics that were previously taught in the first two weeks of the course.

• screenshot is nice to have

• description of main features
  The TicTacToe web application loads a board which the players can play on.
  "X" or Player 1 goes first and Player 2 follows with the "O".
  Once a combination of 3 "X"s or 3 "O" is found the app displays the winner.
  There is a reset button that allows the play to be repeated without refreshing the page.

• list of any known bugs
  -When the winner is decided the player can still click on the empty squares.
  -The game allows users changing already occupied squares.
  -When the winner is shown on the page the reset button is pushed to the left of the screen.

• tech used
